# frontend-application

## Version 0.0.2

This is final version we are building. This is for all the marbles.

### Purpose of this version

To have something to handin at the start of May.

## What is this application

The application is used to keep track of disc golf games played. It keeps track of who is playing, the score of each player and shares the information between players in real time. 

## Tools

The code is written in Visual Studio Code with a wide variety of pluggins.

We use Prettier+ESLint with a set of custom rules for code formating and to insure that the team has a unified style in the code witten.

The backend is a wide selection of different AWS services. The scope of services changes as we discover different ways to execute our vision. Currently we are looking at AWS Amplify and AppSync with its GraphQL features. The data is stored in a DynamoDB NO-SQL database and uses Cognito to authenticate the users.

The frontend uses VueJS along with some of it's packages. They are Vuex, Vue-Router and prebuilt components from Vuetify.

We try to embrace the ideas of JAM Stack for this project and make the developer environment as friendly as possible.

## The Team

Arnar Arnarson, Dagur Kristjánsson and Ægir Tómasson.
