          <v-card-text>
            Disc golf is played like ball golf using a flying disc. One point is counted each time
            the disc is thrown and when a penalty is incurred. The object is to acquire the lowest
            score. Below you will find terms you will need to be familiar with.

          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Tee Throws</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            Tee throws must be completed within or behind the designated tee area. Do not throw
            until the players in front of you are out of range.
          </v-card-text>
          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Lie</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            The spot where the previous throw has landed, mark with a mini disc or leave the disc as
            is. Your next throw is taken behind your lie on the "line of play", an imaginary line
            that runs from the target through the center of your marker. One foot must be on the
            "line of play" at the time of release, no more than 30 cm. behind, and no supporting
            point, most often the other foot, may be ahead of your lie at the time of release.

          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Throwing Order</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            After teeing off, the player whose disc is farthest from the hole always throws first.
            The player with the least amount of throws on the previous hole is the first to tee off
            on the next hole.

          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Completion Of Hole</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            A disc that comes to rest in the basket or chains constitutes the successful completion
            of that hole. A disc on top of the basket does not count as completion. As for tonals,
            once a disc hits the target, the hole is complete.
          </v-card-text>
          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Un-Playable Lie</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            Any disc that comes to rest above the ground is considered an un-playable lie. The disc
            must be thrown from the lie on the ground, directly underneath the un-playable lie. In
            the case of excessive mud, puddles or to get out of harms way, prickly or poisonous
            plants, harmful insects etc, you may back up on the line of play, up to 5 metres to
            establish your ' lie ' without penalty.
          </v-card-text>
          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Out Of Bounds</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            A throw that lands out of bounds, must be played from a point 3 feet in bounds from
            where the disc went out of bounds or rethrown from the previous lie. Permanent water
            hazards and public roads are always out of bounds. Each course will have their own
            specified out of bounds.
          </v-card-text>
          <v-card-title class="font-weight-bold">Penalties</v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            There is no relief from obstacles that were present before you threw. A player may not
            move branches that are between his disc and the basket. (1 stroke penalty) If a player
            purposely moves or breaks any object between the disc and the hole a 2 stroke penalty is
            incurred. Otherwise recreational players will not be penalized for rule infractions.
            Other players will keep you honest.
